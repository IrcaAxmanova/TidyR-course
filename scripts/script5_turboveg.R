# Real world data from a database - challenge to prepare tidy data
# data from a database export (Turboveg, Czech species list) [Real-worl-data_IA]
# tvabund â€“ species data in a long format, opened as dbf file from Turbowin/data/xx , species names as codes, cover as codes
# tvhabita - header data,each releve has RELEVE_NR code, which matches the one in tvabund
# species - species list, to translate the species codes to species names, stored in the Turbowin/species as species.dbf
# nomenclature - alternative, file where the Turboveg codes are matched to more name variants/ Danihelka, Kaplan, ESy (file name: nomenclatureCZ-2023-04-02-IA)
# cover - translation of cover codes to %, requires info on the cover-abundance scale (tvhabita) (file name: coverCZ-2023-04-07-IA)
